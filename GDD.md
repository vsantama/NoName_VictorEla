## Description
Our game is a Mario-type scroller game (that doesn't automatically scroll), where you control a character escaping a monster
following them from the side of the screen.
Apart from that, there are other enemies and obstacles that you either have to avoid or defeat by completing mini-puzzles.
The objective is to last as long as possible alive.     

2. ## Scope & Target Audience</h2>

 Our target audience is a young audience, with an age range of 14 to 30 year old.

### 4.1 Levels

There are no levels as such, but the background of the game changes to give a sensation of progress.
                  
### 4.2 Characters and enemies

At the beggining of the game there's a default character to play, there are other two unlockable characters that can be unlocked with points from the game.
Also, players can upload a png to use as a customized character.

The main enemy is a monster following your character from the left side of the main screen. The slower you are avoiding and defeating obstacles the closer the monster gets to you, and as soon as it touches (or eats) you, you die.

There are other smaller enemies that act as obstacles.
                    
### 4.3 Obstacles

There are three main obstacles: small enemies, boulders and rocks.

Small enemies block the way, and can only be defeated by solving word puzzles. If you fail, the enemy strikes your character and removes life points.

Boulders are similar to small enemies, but don't attack you. There are three types: bronze
boulders, silver boulders and gold boulders. The more valuable the material is, the more puzzles you have to complete to destroy the boulder. 

Rocks fall from the ceiling, and remove some life points if they hit your character. To avoid this you must move your character to dodge them.   

### 4.4 Other elements</h3>

As you move along the scrolling map you'll find different powerups.
