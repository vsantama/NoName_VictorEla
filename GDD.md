##Description
Our game is a Mario-type scroller game (that doesn't automatically scroll), where you control a character escaping a monster<br>
following them from the side of the screen.
Apart from that, there are other enemies and obstacles that you either have to avoid or defeat<br> by completing mini-puzzles.
The objective is to last as long as possible alive.
