           <li><h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
            Our game is a Mario-type scroller game (that doesn't automatically scroll), where you control a character escaping a monster<br>
            following them from the side of the screen.
            Apart from that, there are other enemies and obstacles that you either have to avoid or defeat<br> by completing mini-puzzles.
            The objective is to last as long as possible alive.     
            </p><br><br>
            
            <li><h2>Scope & Target Audience</h2>
            <p>
            Our target audience is a young audience, with an age range of 14 to 30 year old.    
            </p><br><br>
            
            <li><h2>Game Style</h2>

            </p><br><br>
            
            <li><h2>Game content</h2>
                <ul>
                    <h3>4.1 Levels</h3>
                    <p>
                    There are no levels as such, but the background of the game changes to give a sensation of advancement.    
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <h3>4.2 Characters and enemies</h3>
                    <p>
                    At the beggining of the game there's a default character to play, there are other two unlockable characters<br>
                    that can be unlocked with points from the game.<br>
                    <br>
                    Also, players can upload a png to use as a customized character. <br>
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <h3>4.3 Obstacles</h3>
                    <p>
                    There are three main obstacles: small enemies, boulders and rocks.<br>
                    Small enemies block the way, and can only be defeated by solving word puzzles. If you fail, the enemy strikes<br>
                    your character and removes life points.<br><br>
                    Boulders are similar to small enemies, but don't attack you. There are three types: bronze boulders, silver boulders<br>
                    and gold boulders. The more valuable the material is, the more puzzles you have to complete to destroy the boulder.<br>
                    <br>
                    Rocks fall from the ceiling, and remove some life points if they hit your character. To avoid this you must move your<br>
                    character to dodge them.<br>    
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <h3>4.4 Other elements</h3>
                    <p>
                    As you move along the scrolling map you'll find different powerups.
